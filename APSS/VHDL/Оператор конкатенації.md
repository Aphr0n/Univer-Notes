```VHDL
y <=(c(2 downto 1), d(0), d(0), d(0), c(0), 3B"101");
/*
	The () aggregate operator is used to concatenate
	busses. y must be a 9-bit STD_LOGIC_VECTOR.
*/
z <= ("10", 4 => '1', 2 downto 1 =>'1', others =>'0')
/*
	If z is an 8-bit STD_LOGIC_VECTOR,
	the above statement produces:
			z = 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
*/
